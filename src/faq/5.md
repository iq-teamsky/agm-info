key: 5
---

Institutional investors and asset managers have an engagement policy with listed companies that is anchored in the amended European Shareholders' Rights Directive. If everything goes according to plan, this will help listed companies to focus on the long term and enable the transition to an environmentally and socially sustainable economy.
It has been said that retail shareholders , in the same vein, have a non-legal civic responsibility to also become involved with the companies in which they have invested.
Retail shareholders could ask themselves the following questions:

1. Is the company of which I am a shareholder on the right track with respect to Environmental Social Governance-related topics?
2. Is the purpose of the company in balance with the companyâ€™s impact on society?
3. What else can the company contribute to society, other than a good return on investment to its shareholders?
