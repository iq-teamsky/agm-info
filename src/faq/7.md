AGMinfo offers shareholders easy access to comprehensive information about shareholders' meetings in multiple languages. We are currently in consultation with banks to also make it easy  to cast a vote  in shareholders' meetings.

Our **Free Service** provides an overview of shareholder meetings that will be held in the member states of the European Union in the coming week.

Our **Bronze module** provides an annual overview of upcoming and past shareholders 'meetings of 2000+ EU-listed companies. In addition, you receive access to all AGM-related documentation in multiple languages, available on your smartphone or other device of choice.

Our **Silver module** offers the possibility to personalize your information requirements. You can set choices to track indices and companies, and you will receive notifications if there are changes to the information about those companies and indices.

Our **Gold module** offers the possibility to register for shareholder meetings and, if you wish, to cast your proxy vote in advance. We will ensure that your registration and/or proxy vote will reach the bank or company that respectively administrates your equity portfolio or whose shareholder meeting has been convened.
