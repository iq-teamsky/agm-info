There are multiple reasons for participating in an Annual General Meeting, such as
* expressing your views: it does not matter how many shares you own. If shareholders use this right, AGM’s generate value to management. It is the easiest way to effectively communicate your views on certain issues to the company;
* making yourself heard: the AGM provides an opportunity to reach out to other shareholders;
* gaining knowledge: the AGM offers shareholders valuable insight into the company’s affairs.
