key: 3

Our goal to enable all shareholders (large and small) to easily participate at Annual General Meetings (AGM) together with the increased impact of listed companies on society led to the establishment of AGMinfo on October 7th, 2014. Since then, AGMinfo’s website (www.agminfo.eu) has offered (prospective) shareholders and other stakeholders:

* easy access to all necessary AGM-related information
* at one central online location,
* for all the major EU-companies they have invested in,
* at any time.

In short: “All AGM-related information at your fingertips”.
Subsequently AGMinfo’s central AGM-database has evolved into a Communication Platform. The platform can connect all parties that have a (direct or indirect) interest in the company or the outcome of shareholder meetings, i.e.:

* listed companies themselves
* investors
* financial intermediaries
* investor service-providers such as shareholder associations, asset managers, private wealth managers, financial newspapers, analysts etc.

AGMinfo is an independent, non-biased, ESG-driven organization. AGMinfo addresses the need for more shareholder engagement- and related need that shareholders can easily exercise their voting rights, first in the European marketplace and subsequently in other markets.
