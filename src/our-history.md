## Our history

AGMinfo’s roots go back to 2004 when the Foundation for Electronic Communication between Issuers and Shareholders started to promote the digital communication between listed companies and their (prospective) shareholders. For this purpose the first electronic AGM/EGM calendar was created in 2007. It displayed the essential information for all AGM’s and EGM’s of all issuers listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. The calendar was hosted on the SECVA website where interested shareholders could consult the aggregated information free of charge.

To further develop the electronic AGM calendar into a Pan-European, international tool, AGMinfo was founded on October 7th 2014 by Robert Rinnooy Kan, Willem van Santen and seven other co-founders. To accomplish its goal to become the supplier of choice for AGM related information, SECVA’s electronic calendar was rebranded as AGMinfo with <a href="https://www.agminfo.eu/" target="_blank">www.agminfo.eu</a> as its primary site.
